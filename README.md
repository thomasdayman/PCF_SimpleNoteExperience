# PCF - SimpleNoteExperience
Use this control to enable a simplified user experience for creating notes. This control was primarily built for mobile but can also be used on the web.

You will not be able to use these functions on the web (mobile only):

* Capture Image
* Capture Video

## Setup
To allow the PCF control to work on your mobile device you will need to enable these functions below in the settings menu:
